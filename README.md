# Keynest_Technology-and-Innovation-management

Created this Marvel App project to showcase the design prototypes for Keynest, a student housing app. The project highlights user flows tailored to streamline the student housing experience. By gathering feedback through the prototype, I focused on refining the interface to ensure it is intuitive, user-friendly, and aligned with the needs of students seeking accommodation.
The KeyNest app is designed to improve the rental accommodation search experience for international students. On the GISA Facebook page, students often face difficulties contacting house owners and verifying property details. In contrast, KeyNest offers a secure platform that provides verified listings and easier communication. It reduces the risks of scams and fraud by offering transparency and accuracy in property information, ensuring that students can find safe and reliable housing options efficiently.
