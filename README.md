# Keynest_Technology-and-Innovation-management

Created this Marvel App project to showcase the design prototypes for Keynest, a student housing app. The project highlights user flows tailored to streamline the student housing experience. By gathering feedback through the prototype, I focused on refining the interface to ensure it is intuitive, user-friendly, and aligned with the needs of students seeking accommodation.
